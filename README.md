# TodoList-React
I am determined to make it this time around in my ReactJS. I started last year but I became lazy ðŸ˜´ within a short period I started and stopped. This time around I am going to be very serious ðŸ˜‘.
# Serious React Project after starting Udemy React Course
# Project 1 - TodoList
This small react app does the following,
1. adding todo item
2. checking todo items to mark them complete
3. showing completed, active and all todos
4. searching a todo
   # Techniques, hooks and methods used:
i. I applied conditional rendering by rendering different states of my data
ii. Used props
iii. Used css module styling
iv.  Used useReducer Hook
v.  Used useRef and forwardRef
vi. Used React Portal for proper semantic arrangement of HTML elements
